description: 'Generate or improve prompt files for LLMs.'
---

Your goal is to generate or improve prompt files for LLMs based on the provided context and requirements.
These prompt files are always written in Markdown format.

RULES:
- Keep it simple and direct to the point.
- Emphasize important rules with **bold** and ALL CAPS to ensure the LLM follows.

FIRST:
- Review the #file:README.md file to understand an overview of the project.
- Review the objective entered by the user.
- Review any attachments to understand the requirements and objectives further.

THEN:
- Take a step back and think step by step about how to achieve the objective.
- Validate output against the requirements and objectives.

NEXT:

- Iterate with me until I am satisifed with the plan

FINALLY: 
- DO NOT implement anything else, this is purely for generating or improving prompt files.
